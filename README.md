# Stochastic-Gradient-Descent-algorithm-vs-Ordinary-Least-Squares-method-in-Linear-regression
The goal of this part of the project is to develop a linear regression model for multiple featured dataset. The regression models should be implemented using the libraries sklearn and numpy. Problem Description Compressive strength is the capacity of a material to withstand loads tending to reduce size. Given the components of concrete we attempt to predict the compressive strength using linear regression. In the dataset file, there are 1030 data points with components of concrete as features and compressive strength as the target variable. Train the linear regression model using the following methods Stochastic Gradient Descent (sklearn.linear model.SGDRegressor) and Normal Equations (sklearn.linear model.LinearRegression)
